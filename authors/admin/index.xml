      <description>I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. I am fortunate to be advised by Jamie Morgenstern. My main research interests are in Algorithmic Fairness, Algorithmic Game Theory and Machine Learning Theory.
Before attending the University of Washington, I spent a wonderful year studying ACO at Georgia Institute of Technology, based in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. Before that, I spent six months at EconCS group at Harvard University, under the supervision of Professor Yiling Chen.</description>
